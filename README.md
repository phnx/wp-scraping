Wordpress Entry Scraping with R (July 2016)
==============

Basic requirement: an XML file exported from Wordpress, default settings
--------------

Unless it's working, I assume it's not - since you're reading this, review XML pathes in the code.
Make sure they're consistent with your actual XML input.

Enjoy mining.
