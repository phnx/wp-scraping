I locked myself up in the house for the whole Saturday while working on a side project. There're several things I clearly see about myself from all this practice. 1) I need to have some side jobs in my life, whatever they are. It's not necessarily because I want to earn more, but side jobs make me concentrate and stay in the discipline of working. Through the time, I've learned that if I've too much free time on my hand, I'll likely be doing non-sense stuff that won't improve anything from any aspect. I'd say that keeping my head buried under the pile of additional works would help me focus better on the real job I'm doing. Working is my kind of meditation.

2) I'm still connected to my trade. I've come a distance from where I start, but the root of my skill is among all technical stuff. And it sticks with me till this day. From the first point I made about side job, I might not be able get my best focus if it's not programming job. Although this hasn't been proven, , I'm 90% sure that I'm right.

3) My eyesights deteriorate significantly. I cannot tell if it's because I'm getting older or if it's because of my 10-hours-straight-in-fron-of-the-monitor lifestyle. But I can say that my eyes will be a big hurdle in my life later. I must get myself a new pair of eyeglasses as soon as I return to Thailand. Cannot effort such fancy price product here in the US.

Saturday night beer talk featured a new tenant in our house. We're planing for next week's gathering because of a long weekend. 4th of July in the capitol is coming.





I woke up at 11am on Sunday and immediately went out for a run. I made almost 9km and found a new amusing area in the Rock Creak Trail systems. After coming back and washed myself, I went to the mall to get some beer supply with the help of the new tenant. "In the land of carless people, he who owns a car (however wrecked it is) is king" - some random ancient Roman proverb, I believe.

I continued to work on the side project when I came back. There's not much to mention because I fell asleep on the rocking chair in living room for an hour.. Well, that's Sunday evening rest.

There're a few purchases I'd made this week. One is a T-shirt. And I finally got a bed lamp. Now I can read and keep my laptop away before going to sleep.





Ready for another week? Nah.
