 this space contains my own abstract opinions, and logical information that passes through me in public and private domains. I record them as a collection of my daily storyline, and I'm trying my best to cover the absolute credentials of other related entities unless publishable, except those belonged to myself.


See it as your bedtime (although more like restroom) fictions.
